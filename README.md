### SQL Project: Analyzing Population and COVID-19 Deaths

#### **Project Title**: 
Population and COVID-19 Deaths Analysis Using SQL

#### **Project Description**:
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global populations by exploring the relationships between population demographics, COVID-19 deaths, and related statistics using SQL. The project focuses on extracting insights from a database containing information about global population data, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and regional health metrics.

#### **Objectives**:
1. **Data Organization**: Organize data from multiple sources into a structured SQL database, including population statistics, COVID-19 cases, and deaths across different countries and regions.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Compare COVID-19 death rates across different countries and regions.
   - Analyze the relationship between population density and COVID-19 mortality rates.
   - Study the impact of age demographics on death rates.
3. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Generate SQL queries to produce reports on trends in COVID-19 deaths over time.
   - Identify outliers and significant patterns in the data.
   - Provide insights through detailed summaries and graphs created using exported query results.

#### **Dataset Overview**:
The database includes the following key tables:
- **Population**: Contains data on country names, population size, population density, age group distribution, and urban vs rural distribution.
- **COVID_Stats**: Contains daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing rates.
- **location**: Includes region names
- **date**: Tracks the progression of COVID-19 metrics over time for each region.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Dynamic Queries**: Write SQL queries to filter data by region, time period, or demographic attributes.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Use SQL's window functions to calculate rolling averages and identify trends in cases and deaths.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
- A database management system  MySQL

#### **Outcomes**:
- A detailed understanding of how population factors influenced COVID-19 death rates.
- A SQL script repository containing queries for specific insights.
- Recommendations for policymakers based on findings.

This project provides a comprehensive SQL-based approach to analyzing a critical global event and demonstrates the power of structured data in driving meaningful insights.
